# Database Servers

Database servers are the source of your backups. Databasement can connect to and backup MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB servers.

## Adding a Server

1. Navigate to **Database Servers**
2. Click **Add Server**
3. Fill in the connection details:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | A friendly name to identify this server |
| **Type** | The database type (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB) |
| **Host** | Hostname or IP address of the database server |
| **Port** | Database port (3306 for MySQL/MariaDB, 5432 for PostgreSQL) |
| **Username** | Database user for connecting |
| **Password** | User's password |

4. Click **Test Connection** to verify connectivity
5. Click **Save** to add the server

## Connection Requirements

### MySQL / MariaDB

The database user needs the following privileges for backup operations:

```sql
GRANT SELECT, SHOW VIEW, TRIGGER, LOCK TABLES, PROCESS, EVENT, RELOAD
ON database_name.*
TO 'backup_user'@'%';
```

For backing up all databases:

```sql
GRANT SELECT, SHOW VIEW, TRIGGER, LOCK TABLES, PROCESS, EVENT, RELOAD
ON *.*
TO 'backup_user'@'%';
```

### PostgreSQL

The user should have read access to the databases you want to backup:

```sql
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE database_name TO backup_user;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO backup_user;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO backup_user;
```

For full backup capabilities, consider using a superuser or the database owner.

## Testing Connections

Before saving a server, always test the connection:

1. Fill in all connection details
2. Click **Test Connection**
3. The system will attempt to connect and verify credentials
4. If successful, you'll see a confirmation message
5. If it fails, check the error message for troubleshooting

### Common Connection Issues

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Connection refused | Verify host, port, and that the database server is running |
| Access denied | Check username and password |
| Unknown host | Verify the hostname is correct and DNS is resolving |
| Connection timeout | Check firewall rules and network connectivity |

## Editing Servers

1. Go to **Database Servers**
2. Find the server you want to edit
3. Click the **Edit** button
4. Update the connection details
5. Test the connection again
6. Save your changes

## Deleting Servers

1. Go to **Database Servers**
2. Find the server you want to delete
3. Click the **Delete** button
4. Confirm the deletion

:::warning
Deleting a server does not delete its backup snapshots. Existing snapshots will remain in storage but cannot be easily associated with the deleted server.
