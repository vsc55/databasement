# Backups

Databasement allows you to create on-demand backups of your databases. Backups are processed asynchronously, so you can continue using the application while they run.

## How Backups Work

When you create a backup, Databasement:

1. Connects to the database server (via SSH tunnel if configured)
2. Runs the appropriate dump command for the database type
3. Compresses the output with gzip
4. Transfers the compressed file to the selected storage volume
5. Creates a snapshot record with metadata

### Backup Commands

Databasement uses native database tools for reliable backups:

**MySQL/MariaDB:**
```bash
mariadb-dump --routines --add-drop-table --complete-insert --hex-blob --quote-names --skip_ssl \
  --host='...' --port='...' --user='...' --password='...' 'database_name' > dump.sql
```

**PostgreSQL:**
```bash
PGPASSWORD='...' pg_dump --clean --if-exists --no-owner --no-privileges --quote-all-identifiers \
  --host='...' --port='...' --username='...' 'database_name' -f dump.sql
```

**SQLite:**
```bash
cp '/path/to/database.sqlite' dump.db
```

**MongoDB:**
```bash
mongodump --host='...' --port='...' --username='...' --password='...' \
  --authenticationDatabase='admin' --db='database_name' --archive=dump.archive
```

**Redis/Valkey:**
```bash
redis-cli -h '...' -p '...' -a '...' --no-auth-warning --rdb dump.rdb
```

All dumps are then compressed with gzip before being transferred to the storage volume.

## Failed Backups

If a backup fails, check:

1. **Database connectivity**: Can Databasement still connect to the server?
2. **Disk space**: Is there enough space on the storage volume?
3. **Permissions**: Does the database user have backup privileges?
4. **Timeout**: Large databases may need more time

Failed backup reasons are logged and visible in the snapshot details.

## Retention Policies

Retention policies control how long backups are kept before being automatically deleted. Databasement offers two retention strategies:

### Simple (Days-Based)

The simplest option: keep all backups for a specified number of days.

**Example:** With `retention_days = 30`, any backup older than 30 days is automatically deleted.

| Day | Backups Kept |
|-----|--------------|
| 1-30 | All backups |
| 31+ | Deleted |

**Best for:** Short-term backup needs, development environments, or when storage cost isn't a concern.

### GFS (Grandfather-Father-Son)

A tiered retention strategy that keeps recent backups for quick recovery while preserving older snapshots for long-term archival — without keeping every single backup.

**How it works:**

| Tier | What it keeps | Example |
|------|---------------|---------|
| **Daily** (Son) | The N most recent backups | Keep last 7 backups |
| **Weekly** (Father) | 1 backup per week for N weeks | Keep 1/week for 4 weeks |
| **Monthly** (Grandfather) | 1 backup per month for N months | Keep 1/month for 12 months |

**Example with default values (7 daily, 4 weekly, 12 monthly):**

After running daily backups for a year, you'll have approximately:
- **7 recent backups** (last 7 days)
- **4 weekly backups** (one from each of the past 4 weeks)
- **12 monthly backups** (one from each of the past 12 months)

**Total: ~23 backups** instead of 365 — saving significant storage while maintaining recovery points across the entire year.

  ├── Weekly ─────────┤ (4 backups)                        │
  │                   │                                    │
  └── Monthly ─────────────────────────────────────────────┘ (12 backups)
```

**Best for:** Production environments, compliance requirements, or when you need long-term recovery options without excessive storage costs.

:::info Per-Database Retention
Retention policies are applied **per database**, not per server. If you backup 3 databases with GFS (7 daily), each database keeps its own 7 most recent backups — totaling 21 backups across all databases.

### Choosing a Retention Policy

| Scenario | Recommended Policy |
|----------|-------------------|
| Development/testing | Simple: 7-14 days |
| Small production app | Simple: 30 days |
| Business-critical data | GFS: 7d/4w/12m |
| Compliance requirements | GFS: 14d/8w/24m |

:::tip
You can disable any GFS tier by leaving it empty. For example, setting only "Monthly: 12" keeps just one backup per month for a year.

## Best Practices

### Before Production Backups

1. **Test the connection** before creating backups
2. **Verify restore** by testing a restore to a development server
3. **Monitor disk space** on your storage volumes

### Backup Sizing

Compressed backup sizes vary, but as a rough guide:
- A 1GB database typically compresses to 100-300MB
- Text-heavy data compresses better than binary data

### Security Considerations

- Use dedicated backup users with minimal required privileges
- Store backups in secure, encrypted storage when possible
- Regularly test your restore process
