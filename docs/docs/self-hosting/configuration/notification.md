# Notification

Notification settings (enable/disable, channels, recipients) can be configured directly from the **Configuration** page in the web UI.

This page covers additional setup guides for each channel.

## Email {#email}

Databasement uses Laravel's mail system. Configure your mail driver with these environment variables:

### Basic SMTP configuration

```bash
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your-username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=databasement@example.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Databasement"
```

### Encryption options

`MAIL_ENCRYPTION` supports:

- `tls` → STARTTLS (typically port 587)
- `ssl` → SMTPS (typically port 465)
- empty or not set → no encryption enforced

Example without encryption:

```bash
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
MAIL_PORT=25
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=
```

> **Note**
> If your SMTP server runs on port 25 and must not use TLS, but it advertises `STARTTLS`, you must disable auto-TLS explicitly using a DSN.

```bash
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_URL=smtp://smtp.example.com:25?auto_tls=false
```

When `MAIL_URL` is defined, it overrides `MAIL_HOST`, `MAIL_PORT`, `MAIL_USERNAME`, and `MAIL_PASSWORD`.

2. Send `/newbot` and follow the prompts to name your bot
3. BotFather will give you a **Bot Token** — copy it

### Getting a Chat ID

2. Send a message to the bot
3. Open `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates` in a browser
4. Find the `chat.id` value in the JSON response

Enter both the **Bot Token** and **Chat ID** on the Configuration page.

## Pushover {#pushover}

[Pushover](https://pushover.net/) delivers push notifications to your phone and desktop.

1. Create an account at [pushover.net](https://pushover.net/)
2. Copy your **User Key** from the dashboard

## Gotify {#gotify}

[Gotify](https://gotify.net/) is a self-hosted push notification server.

1. Log in to your Gotify server
2. Go to **Apps** and create a new application (e.g., "Databasement")
3. Copy the **App Token**

Enter your **Gotify Server URL** (e.g., `https://gotify.example.com`) and the **App Token** on the Configuration page.

## Webhook {#webhook}

Send failure notifications as JSON payloads to any HTTP endpoint.

Enter your **Webhook URL** on the Configuration page. Optionally, provide a **Webhook Secret** to authenticate requests via the `X-Webhook-Token` header.

### Request Format

Notifications are sent as `POST` requests with a JSON body:

```json
{
  "event": "BackupFailedNotification",
  "title": "Backup Failed: Production DB",
  "body": "A backup job has failed.",
  "fields": {
    "Server": "Production DB",
    "Database": "myapp"
  },
  "error": "Connection refused",
  "action_url": "https://your-instance.com/backup-jobs/...",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T02:00:00+00:00"
}
```

### Headers

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` |
| `X-Webhook-Token` | The configured secret (only if a secret is configured) |

### Tip: Using with Apprise

The webhook channel can be pointed at an [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) API endpoint to relay notifications to 100+ services (Ntfy, Matrix, Mattermost, etc.). Set the Apprise stateless endpoint (e.g., `https://apprise.example.com/notify/`) as your Webhook URL.

## What Gets Notified

Notifications are sent only for **failures**:

- **Backup failures**: When a scheduled or manual backup fails
- **Restore failures**: When a restore operation fails
- **Missing snapshots**: When snapshot file verification detects missing backup files on storage volumes

Successful operations do not trigger notifications.

## Notification Content

Each notification includes:

- Server name
- Database name
- Error message
- Timestamp
- Direct link to the failed job details
